Overview and Compiling
The overall purpose of our project “The Harvard Study Hubs” was to create a website that allows users to give and receive feedback regarding Harvard's several study spaces and Libraries. You can access the website by using cs50 ide. You have to download all of the required files and execute flask run in the terminal.

Login and Register
To use our website a user must have a registered account. All users have to submit a unique username that does not already belong to another user. They also have to create a password that is at least 8 characters long in order to make an account. This information will then be stored in a database. After a user has registered they can then log in using their approved credentials.

Add a Location and Rate a Location
All logged in users are allowed to rate a location by clicking the corresponding link. To Add a location you must input the name of the location, other qualities that you are prompted to submit, and any additional comments that you would like to express. You have to full in all fields in order for your location to be successfully added to the database. Users are also allowed to rate locations that have already been added.
To do this all you have to do is click on the rate a location link at the top of the page. This will take you to a page that allows you to select the location that you would like to rate and then select ratings for said location.
